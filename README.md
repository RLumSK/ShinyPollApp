# ShinyPollApp

This [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) application was developed to conduct a brief poll on missing 
features in [R](https://www.r-project.org) with regard do geosciences during a [PICO session](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2017/session/24971) organised 
by Michael Dietze, Sebastian Kreutzer and Oliver Korup at the [EGU 2017](http://www.egu2017.eu) 
in Vienna (Austria). 

The application uses an external [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB) to
store the results.
